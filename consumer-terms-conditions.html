            <h4>WHAT ARE MY CONSUMER RIGHTS WHEN ORDERING FOOD?</h4>
            <p>You are entitled and can expect your food to be as described, satisfactory quality and prepared with due skill and care. If you are not happy with the food you should to complain straight away. </p>
            <h4>CAN YOU REFUSE TO PAY FOR BAD FOOD? </h4>
            <p>The Consumer Rights Act 2015 states that your food ought to be as described on the menu and satisfactory quality. You can refuse to pay for food that is not as described on the menu. This does not apply if you have taken the food away from the premises or eaten the food. Take photos using your mobile phone as evidence in case you need to use it at a later date. You cannot claim a refund once you have accepted the food or later eaten it.</p>
            <h4>HOW DO I COMPLAIN ABOUT A BAD FOOD? </h4>
            <p>You ought to speak to a staff member in the first instance. Be specific about what you would like to remedy the issue. You can expect a refund for food you have not eaten and returned. This must be taken upon with the Food Services supplier, not the Booking Service, the Booking Service (Grub Direct) has no liability for the food or good supplied by the Food Service Provider. What is “reasonable” is subjective though. The litmus test is, “What would a reasonable person expect in the eyes of the law?”.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">If you have ordered food which has to be prepared and cooked to your specific order and you later decide you do not want it you cannot claim a refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.If you have ordered food which has to be prepared and cooked to your specific order and you later decide you do not want it you cannot claim a refund under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. </p>
